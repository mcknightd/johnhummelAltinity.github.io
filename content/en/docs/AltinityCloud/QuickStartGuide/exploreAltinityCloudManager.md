*   **A**: Cluster Creation: Clusters can be created from scratch with **Launch Cluster**, or the structure and settings configured with JSON through **Import**.
*   **B**: Clusters:  Each cluster associated with your Altinity.Cloud account is listed in either tile format, or as a short list.  They’ll display a short summary of their health and performance.  By selecting a cluster, you can view the full details.
*   **C**: User Management:  Change which organization you are currently working in and update your Account Settings.
