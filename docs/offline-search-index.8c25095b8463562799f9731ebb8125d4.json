The default page is the Altinity Cloud Manager.\nThe Altinity Cloud Manager page is separated into the following sections:\n A: Cluster Creation: Clusters can be created from scratch with Launch Cluster, or the structure and settings configured with JSON through Import. B: Clusters: Each cluster associated with your Altinity.Cloud account is listed in either tile format, or as a short list. They’ll display a short summary of their health and performance.

For people who are new to ClickHouse, creating tables is very similar to other SQL based databases, with some extra syntax that defines the type of table we’re making. This is part of what gives ClickHouse its speed. For complete details on ClickHouse commands, see theClickHouse SQL Reference Guide.\nCluster Explore The Cluster Explore page allows you to run queries, view the schema, and check on processes for your cluster. It’s a quick way of getting into your ClickHouse database, run commands and view your schema straight from your web browser. We’ll be using this to generate our first tables and input some data.\nTo access Cluster Explore for your cluster, just click Explore for the specific cluster to manage.\nFor our example, we’re going to create two tables:\n events_local: This table will use the ReplicatedMergeTree table engine. If you don’t know about table engines, don’t worry about that for now. See theClickHouse Engines page for complete information. events: This table will be distributed on your cluster with the Distributed table engine.  In our examples, we’ll be using macro variables - these are placed between curly brackets and let us use the same SQL commands on different clusters and environments without having to fill in every detail. Any time you see an entry like {cluster} or {shard} you should recognize those as a macro variable.\nThe commands below will create these tables into the default database on your cluster.\nCreate Tables To create your first tables:\n  From the Altinity Cloud Manager select Explore for the cluster to manage**.**\n  Select Query.\n  For our first table, copy and paste the following into the Query window, then select Execute.\n  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events_local ON CLUSTER ‘{cluster}’ ( event_date Date, event_type Int32, article_id Int32, title String ) ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/{cluster}/tables/{shard}/{database}/{table}', ‘{replica}') PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date) ORDER BY (event_type, article_id);\n You should see the following under **Execute** confirming the commands ran, just replacing **docdemo** with your cluster: docdemo.demo.beta.altinity.cloud:8443 (query time: 0.342s) chi-docdemo-docdemo-0-0\t9000 0\t1\t0 chi-docdemo-docdemo-0-1\t9000 0\t0\t0\n 4. Now let’s create our second table. Back in the **Query** window, enter the following and select **Execute**: ``` CREATE TABLE events ON CLUSTER '{cluster}' AS events_local ENGINE = Distributed('{cluster}', default, events_local, rand()) Once again, you should see confirmation under **Execute**: ```  docdemo.demo.beta.altinity.cloud:8443 (query time: 0.162s) chi-docdemo-docdemo-0-0\t9000 0\t1\t0 chi-docdemo-docdemo-0-1\t9000 0\t0\t0\n 5. Now that we have some tables, let’s not leave them empty. Inserting data into a ClickHouse table is very similar to most SQL systems. Let’s Insert our data, then do a quick Select on it. Enter the following Insert command into **Query**, then select **Execute**: ``` INSERT INTO events VALUES(today(), 1, 13, 'Example'); You’ll see the results confirmed under **Execute**, just like before.  OK. Then enter the following **Select** command and select **Execute** again: \\  SELECT * FROM events; The results will look like the following:  docdemo.demo.beta.altinity.cloud:8443 (query time: 0.018s) ┌─event_date─┬─event_type─┬─article_id─┬─title───┐ │ 2020-11-19 │ 1 │ 13 │ Example │ └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴─────────┘ View Schema The Database Schema shows a graphical view of your cluster’s database, the tables in it, and their structure.\nTo view your Schema:\n From the Altinity Cloud Manager select Explore for the cluster to manage**.** Select Schema.  You can expand the databases to display the tables in each database, or select the table to view its details, schema, and some sample rows.\nView Processes To view current actions running on your cluster select Processes. This displays what processes are currently running, what user account they are running under, and allows you to view more details regarding the process.\n","excerpt":"Once your cluster is created, time to create some tables and do some …","ref":"/docs/altinitycloud/quickstartguide/yourfirstqueries/","title":"Your First Queries"},{"body":"Now that we’ve shown how to create a cluster and use ClickHouse SQL queries into your new cluster, let’s connect to it remotely.\nFor the following, we’re going to be using the clickhouse-client program, but the same process will help you gain access from your favorite client.\nFull instructions for installing ClickHouse can be found on theClickHouse Installation page. We’ll keep this simple and assume you’re using a Linux environment like Ubuntu. For this example, we set up a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04.\nFirst, we need to know our connection details for our Altinity.Cloud ClickHouse cluster. To view your connection details:\n  From the Altinity Cloud Manager, select Access Point for the cluster to manage.\n  From here, you can copy and paste the settings for the ClickHouse client. For example:\n  clickhouse-client -h yourdataset.yourcluster.altinity.cloud –port 9440 -s –user=admin –password\n ## **ClickHouse Client** The ClickHouse Client is a command line based program that will be familiar ### **Setting Up ClickHouse Client in Linux** If you’ve already set up ClickHouse client, then you can skip this step. For those who need quick instructions on how to install ClickHouse client in their deb based Linux environment (like Ubuntu), use the following: * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: As of this document’s publication, version 20.13 and above of the ClickHouse client is required to connect with the SNI enabled clusters. These instructions use the testing version of that client. An updated official stable build is expected to be released soon. sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates dirmngr sudo apt-key adv –keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 –recv E0C56BD4\necho “deb https://repo.clickhouse.tech/deb/testing/ main/” | sudo tee\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y clickhouse-client\n ### **Connect With ClickHouse Client** If your ClickHouse client is ready, then you can copy and paste your connection settings into your favorite terminal program, and you’ll be connected. \u003cp id=\"gdcalert2\" \u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\"\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png).

These instructions are very minimal, and are intended just to get you working in Python with your new Altinity.Cloud cluster. These instructions are in the `bash` shell and require the following be installed in your environment: * `Python 3.7` and above * The Python module venv * `git` * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: We will be using clickhouse-driver v0.1.6 development build, which has support for Server Name Indication (SNI) when using TLS communications. To connect with the Python clickhouse-driver: 1. **(Optional)** Setup your local environment. For example: \\ ``` python3 -m venv test . test/bin/activate  Install the driver with pip3: \\\n  pip3 install git+https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver@master#egg=clickhouse-driver\n 3. Start Python. 4. Add the client and connection details. Cluster Explore provides the necessary information to link directly to your cluster. \u003cp id=\"gdcalert3\" \u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold\"\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e\u003e gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png).

Run client.execute and submit your query. Let’s just look at the tables from within Python:    client.execute(‘SHOW TABLES in default’) [(‘events’,), (‘events_local’,)]\n    6. You can perform selects and inserts as you need. For example, continuing from our[ Your First Querie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skoWxs8UJcfaAPW0d5hA6DkTsBN3QJRFil_BmS9_YOA/edit#heading=h.pwrx6f4309bl)s using **Cluster Explore** above:    result = client.execute(‘SELECT * FROM default.events’) print(result) [(datetime.date(2020, 11, 23), 1, 13, ‘Example’)]\n    For more information see the article[ Clickhouse And Python: Getting To Know The Clickhouse-driver Client](https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-python-getting-to-know-the-clickhouse-driver-client).
